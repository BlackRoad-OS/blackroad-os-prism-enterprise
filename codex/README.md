# Codex Automation

This directory houses utilities that support recurring engineering
rituals across the BlackRoad platform. The centerpiece is a lightweight
**BlackRoad pipeline** script that demonstrates how commits can move
from a developer workstation to deployment. The script is intentionally
modular so additional steps—such as quality gates or integration hooks—
can drop in without rewriting the entire workflow.

## Policy Stubs

Policy stubs keep our living commitments easy to find outside of the full
Codex entries. They live at the repository root so operations, product, and
policy teams can reference them without digging through subdirectories.

- [WONDER.md](../WONDER.md) — captures the active Wonder commitments that map
  to [Codex 042 — The Wonder Clause](entries/042-wonder-clause.md).

## BlackRoad Pipeline

```bash
python3 codex/agents/blackroad_pipeline.py "Push latest to BlackRoad.io"
```

Available commands:

* `Push latest to BlackRoad.io` – commit, push, then kick off a deploy.
* `Refresh working copy and redeploy` – update the branch before deploy.
* `Rebase branch and update site` – rebase on `origin/main` prior to push.
* `Sync Salesforce -> Airtable -> Droplet` – placeholder for connector syncs.

Each command prints the high-level actions it would perform. Real OAuth
or webhook integrations can be added later by filling in the TODO
sections.

### Prism console multi-repo integrator

`codex/tools/prism_repo_integrator.py` coordinates git hygiene, optional
tests, and deploy hooks across the Prism console repository plus its
closest satellites (API gateway, product site, ingest jobs). The helper
reads `codex/tools/prism_repo_integrations.json` so adding a new
repository is as simple as appending a new entry.

```bash
python codex/tools/prism_repo_integrator.py status              # show git status for every repo
python codex/tools/prism_repo_integrator.py sync --dry-run      # preview commit/push flow
python codex/tools/prism_repo_integrator.py test api-gateway    # run configured tests for a subset
```

Pass `--config` to load a different JSON manifest or `--root` to point
the paths at another workspace checkout.

## Codex Agent (“next” trigger watcher)

`codex/tools/codex-agent.sh` can run on any Linux host to watch for a
`next` flag, capture diagnostics, and optionally call a webhook. The
tool clears the trigger file after every run, gathers device stats, and
reboots unless `REBOOT_ON_TRIGGER=false` is set. Environment variables
(`PINGBACK_URL`, `STATE_FILE`, `NEXT_TOKEN`, `MAX_DIAG_LINES`) customise
its behaviour without editing the script.

## Auditing Historic Entries

Use the audit helper to list every entry and catch early-branch
fingerprints:

```bash
python3 codex/tools/codex_entries_audit.py
```

Add `--format json` for machine-readable output that downstream
automation can ingest.
Each command prints the high level actions it would perform.  Real OAuth
or webhook logic can be added by filling in the TODO sections inside the
script.
