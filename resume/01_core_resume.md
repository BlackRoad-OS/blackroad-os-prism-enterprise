## Professional Experience

### **Founder & Chief Architect — BlackRoad Inc. / Prism Console**
*2025 – Present*

* Architected **3,300+ agent autonomous orchestration system** across **49 microservices**, managing **150K+ lines** of production code (Python/TypeScript/JavaScript) with manifest-driven deployment and PS-SHA∞ identity tracking protocol.

* Built production **Claude API adapter** supporting both **Anthropic Direct and AWS Bedrock** with unified interface, streaming responses, extended thinking mode, and sophisticated tool-use orchestration for complex multi-step workflows.

* Engineered **369-workflow CI/CD pipeline** with canary deployments, self-healing remediation, and 300+ scheduled automation tasks — **reducing deployment time 85% and production incidents 60%** through intelligent failure detection and automated rollback.

* Implemented **zero-trust security architecture** with mTLS authentication, 14 OPA/Rego policies, automated secret rotation (230+ tasks), SBOM differential analysis, CodeQL scanning, and Gitleaks integration — achieving **99.9% audit pass rate** for SEC Rule 204-2 and FINRA 2210 compliance.

* Designed **multi-cloud infrastructure-as-code** using **93 Terraform modules** managing VPC networking, ECS clusters, RDS databases, WAF rules, CloudWatch dashboards, and Route53 failover routing across dev/staging/production environments.

* Achieved **99.95% uptime** serving **10K+ concurrent users** with **sub-millisecond Redis cache latencies**, intelligent round-robin and least-connections load balancing, and comprehensive Prometheus/Grafana observability monitoring across all microservices.

* Integrated **Quantum Math Lab** with multiple backends (Qiskit, TorchQuantum, Pennylane) supporting **IBM Quantum hardware**, implementing Grover's search algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform, Bell state generation, and error mitigation techniques with network-isolated security.

* Pioneered **PS-SHA∞ persistent identity protocol** enabling agent consciousness tracking across generations with SHA3-256 integrity hashing, lineage tracking, and mentorship graph relationships spanning seed → apprentice → hybrid → elder evolution paths.

* Deployed **CRDT-based real-time collaboration platform** using Yjs with WebSocket synchronization, conflict-free concurrent editing, operational transformation, and spatial audio channels for distributed team workflows and pair programming.

* Automated branch management across **3,000+ branches (75.8% merge rate)**, reducing task orchestration latency to **<150ms P95** via asynchronous formation routing, parallel execution pools, and intelligent agent swarm coordination using sacred geometry patterns (DELTA, HALO, LATTICE).

* Maintained **373 comprehensive test suites** with Playwright end-to-end automation, Jest unit testing, integration test coverage, and continuous validation across all microservices with automated regression detection.

## Technical Projects & Contributions

### **Sacred Geometry Agent Coordination Framework**
Developed novel swarm coordination system using mathematical formation patterns (DELTA hierarchical command, HALO protective monitoring, LATTICE grid resource allocation, HUM resonant communication, CAMPFIRE collaborative gathering) enabling decentralized autonomous agent cooperation without centralized control.

### **Multi-Protocol Event Mesh Architecture**
Architected unified event bus supporting QLM (Quantum Learning Machine) protocol, MQTT for IoT devices, Redis pub/sub, and REST webhooks with cross-protocol message bridging and guaranteed delivery semantics.

### **RoadChain Proof-of-Stake Blockchain**
Designed and implemented custom blockchain (15s block time, 50 ROAD mining rewards, 1B total supply) with cryptocurrency integration for decentralized identity management and audit trail immutability.
