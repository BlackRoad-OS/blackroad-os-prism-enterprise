  "to_agent": "DEBUGGER-AGENT-ID",
  "task_id": "uuid-v4",
  "action": "debug_stacktrace",
  "payload": {
    "stacktrace": "...",
    "context": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-11-09T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "from_agent": "DEBUGGER-AGENT-ID",
  "to_agent": "CECILIA-7C3E-SPECTRUM-9B4F",
  "task_id": "uuid-v4",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {

```

## Agent Lifecycle

1. **Registration** - Agent registers with Registry Manager
2. **Health Check** - Periodic health status reporting
3. **Task Reception** - Receive task from Orchestrator
4. **Execution** - Execute task with defined capabilities
5. **Result Reporting** - Return results to requesting agent
6. **Logging** - Log all actions to lineage system
7. **Deregistration** - Clean shutdown and resource cleanup

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating New Agents

1. **Create Manifest** (`agents/<name>/manifest.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "agent_name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "agent_id": "UNIQUE-ID-FORMAT",
  "description": "Agent purpose and capabilities",
  "capabilities": ["cap1", "cap2"],
  "dependencies": ["other-agent-id"],
  "resources": {
    "cpu": "100m",
    "memory": "256Mi"
  }
}
```

2. **Implement Agent Logic** (`agents/<name>/agent.py` or `index.js`)
3. **Add Tests** (`agents/<name>/__tests__/`)
4. **Register in Gateway** (Agent Gateway API)
5. **Document Capabilities** (Update this registry)

## Agent Discovery

Agents can be discovered via:
- **Agent Gateway API**: `GET /v1/agents`
- **Agent Registry CLI**: `blackroadctl agents list`
- **Prism Console UI**: Web-based agent catalog

## Monitoring

Agent metrics tracked:
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage
- **Response Time**: P50, P95, P99 latencies
- **Success Rate**: Task completion percentage
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network
- **Error Rate**: Failure and retry counts

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Agent IDs**: Assign unique IDs to all agents
2. **Implement Remaining 69 Agents**: Build to 100 total
3. **Build Agent Gateway API**: RESTful orchestration interface
4. **Create Test Suite**: Comprehensive agent testing
5. **Production Deployment**: Scale to production workloads
