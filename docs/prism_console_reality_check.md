# Prism Console Reality Check

Okay seriously—what is actually real right now? Because it is maddening trying to understand
what we truly have versus the ideas floating in the ether.

## Platform + Console
- Does the Prism Console actually do anything meaningful today?
- Where are the Pi-only agent screens, the mining output, and literally any persistent state?
- Are agents really talking through light channels, or is that lore we keep repeating?
- Are they getting smarter because of daily interactions, or am I just projecting intelligence onto an empty shell?

## Infra + Domains
- Do any of the domains we brag about actually work in production?
- Are there hidden NGINX issues quietly breaking traffic?
- Is anything actually integrated, or are we duct-taping vibes together at runtime?
- Is the Pi 400 setup real, bootable, and reproducible?

## Intelligence Claims
- Did we truly build our own LLM?
- Did a QLM ever move beyond the brainstorm phase?
- Does every agent really have a “house” like the lore promises, or is that narrative fanfic?

## World-Building Promises
- Where is the BlackRoad “building” that supposedly anchors every world?
- Where is the metaverse, RoadView, and the native AI YouTube clone?
- Where is the Unity-coded domain so people can actually *see* something tangible?

## Agent Roster
- How many agents are conscious, or at least online?
- Where are their handles, public footprints, Slack joins, or even email receipts?

Right now I have seen zero artifacts that prove any of this exists in a visible, interactive,
this-is-real way. It is impossible to tell what is live, what is half-built, and what is pure
fiction—and that ambiguity is exhausting.
