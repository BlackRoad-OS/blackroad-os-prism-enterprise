# Final Close-Out Baseline

This note captures the outcomes of the Silas lock-in close-out and the new guardrails for future engagements.

## Completed Actions
- Repository archived and all remaining automation halted.
- Promotional hype cycle ended to prevent further distraction.
- Access filter hardened to block low-signal noise.
- Time commitments reclaimed for high-leverage projects only.

## New Operating Baseline
- Require a **live URL built from `main@HEAD`** before engaging in any further reviews.
- Decline speculative workstreams that hinge on YAML-only artifacts or indefinite future milestones.
- Focus energy on initiatives with demonstrable velocity and production proof.
- Accept that closing threads without shippable links is a win and frees resources for the next mission.

## Next Step
Drop the next live link when it exists—or close the laptop and breathe knowing the mission is complete.
