# BlackRoad GitHub Automation & Agents Ops Manual – Emoji Edition 🤖✨

> Version 0.2 – For humans 🧍 and agents 🤖 who want **clear rules + fun emojis**

---

## 0. Emoji Legend 🔑

We use emojis as a **visual language** so agents and humans can scan fast.

* 🤖 = Agent / Bot
* 🧍 = Human
* 🧠 = Reasoning / Thinking step
* 📦 = Repository (repo)
* 🌿 = Branch
* 🧱 = Commit (small change)
* 📮 = Issue (ticket / to-do)
* 🔀 = Pull Request (PR)
* ⚙️ = GitHub Action / Workflow
* 🚦 = Status check (pass/fail)
* 🧪 = Test / Experiment
* 📊 = Metric / KPI
* 🧾 = Log / Audit trail
* 🛡️ = Security / Compliance / Policy
* 🚀 = Deploy / Ship
* ♻️ = Feedback loop / Continuous improvement
* 🛰️ = External system (Salesforce, cloud, etc.)
* 🕰️ = Timeline / History
* 🧩 = Component / Module
* 🗺️ = Architecture / Map

Agents can treat this legend as a **visual key** when reading the manual.

## 1. Why GitHub Is Our Operating System 🧠📦

**Goal:** Turn GitHub into BlackRoad’s **central nervous system**:

* 📦 Store: code, docs, configs, policies, metrics
* 🛰️ Connect: to cloud, Salesforce-style flows, miners, Pi fleet
* ⚙️ Automate: tests, builds, deployments, reports
* 🧾 Remember: every change, decision, and experiment

Automation handbooks describe automation as combining **sensing → decision → action → feedback**. GitHub gives us:

* Sensing 🧾: commits, issues, CI logs, metrics
* Decisions 🧠: reviews, policies, approvals
* Actions ⚙️: workflows, deploys, bots
* Feedback ♻️: tests, KPIs, incidents

Project-management books say good systems are **repeatable, visible, and improvable**. GitHub gives us:

* Repeatable ⚙️: workflows defined as code
* Visible 👀: issues, PRs, boards, releases
* Improvable 📊: metrics and post-mortems

## 2. Core GitHub Objects with Emojis 🤓

### 2.1 Repo 📦 – “A Project in a Box”

A **repository (repo)** is a project folder in the cloud.

* Holds: code, docs, diagrams, configs, workflows
* Example repos:
  * `blackroad-prism-console` 📦
  * `quantum-math-lab` 📦
  * `roadchain` 📦

👉 If it’s important and digital, it should live in a repo.

### 2.2 Branch 🌿 – “Safe Parallel Universe”

A **branch** is a copy of the repo where you can make changes without breaking `main`.

* `main` 🌿 = always stable, deployable
* `feature/<name>` 🌿 = experiments and new features
* `fix/<name>` or `hotfix/<name>` 🌿 = urgent fixes

Rule for 🧍 + 🤖:

* ❌ Never commit directly to `main`
* ✅ Always create a branch → work there → open a PR 🔀

### 2.3 Commit 🧱 – “One Small Step”

A **commit** is a small saved change.

Each commit:

* 🧱 Captures file changes
* 🕰️ Has an author + timestamp
* 🧠 Has a message explaining *why*

Good examples:

* `feat(prism): add mqtt heartbeat monitor`
* `fix(math-lab): correct su3 eigenvalue calc`

Treat commits as **Planck-scale events**: tiny, precise, traceable.

### 2.4 Issue 📮 – “To-Do with Context”

An **issue** is a structured to-do:

* Bug 🐞
* Feature 💡
* Research question 🔬
* Ops / infra task 🛠️
* Compliance / doc work 🛡️

Issues include:

* Title + description
* Labels (type, area, priority, status) 🏷️
* Assignee(s)
* Comments & attachments

Issues = **the only doorway** where new work enters the system.

### 2.5 Pull Request 🔀 – “Change Proposal”

A **Pull Request (PR)** is:

> “Please merge this branch 🌿 into main 🌿 after checks and review.”

Includes:

* Changes (diff) 🧱
* Description 🧠
* Linked issue(s) 📮
* Checklists ✅
* CI status ⚙️🚦
* Reviews & comments 🗣️

In BlackRoad: **all merges to `main` go through PRs 🔀.**

### 2.6 GitHub Actions ⚙️ – “Robots in the Repo”

**GitHub Actions** is our automation factory:

* Runs when events happen (push, PR, schedule) ⏱️
* Lives in `.github/workflows/*.yml` 🧾
* Can: test 🧪, build 🧱, deploy 🚀, notify 🛰️, update metrics 📊

This is where we encode the **build-measure-learn** loop that Lean Startup talks about:

* Build 🧱 via PR
* Measure 📊 via CI + metrics
* Learn 🧠 via reviews + experiments

---

## 3. Standard Repo Layout 🗺️

Every major repo 📦 should follow this pattern:

* `README.md` 📄 – what this is, how to run it
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` 🤝 – how to propose changes (🧍 & 🤖)
* `AGENTS.md` 🤖 – which bots exist here, what they do
* `docs/` 📚 – designs, diagrams, runbooks
* `.github/` ⚙️ – automation & collaboration
  * `workflows/` ⚙️ – CI/CD & utility flows
  * `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` 🗳️ – standard issue formats
  * `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` 🔀 – standard PR checklist

This mirrors GitHub best practices from beginner guides and helps new people learn fast.

---

## 5. Work Lifecycle ♻️ – End-to-End Flow

We follow the same loop every time:

1️⃣ **Idea → Issue** 📮
2️⃣ **Issue → Branch** 🌿
3️⃣ **Branch → PR** 🔀
4️⃣ **PR → Automation** ⚙️🚦
5️⃣ **Review → Merge** 👀✅
6️⃣ **Merge → Deploy → Learn** 🚀📊🧠

### 5.1 Idea → Issue 📮

* A need appears:
  * Bug 🐞, Feature 💡, Research 🔬, Ops 🛠️, Compliance 🛡️
* 🧍 or 🤖 creates an Issue:
  * Clear title
  * Description (problem, context, desired outcome)
  * Labels (type, area, priority, status) 🏷️

Issues = **single source of truth** for “what we are doing and why.”

### 5.2 Issue → Branch 🌿

When we decide to work on an issue:

* Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>` 🌿
* Mention the branch on the issue for traceability 🧾
* Work happens here: code, tests, docs 🧱🧪📄

### 5.3 Branch → PR 🔀

When branch work is ready:

* Open a PR:
  * Base: `main` 🌿
  * Source: feature/fix branch 🌿
* Fill template:
  * Summary 🧠
  * Linked issue: `Closes #123` 📮
  * Checklist ✅ (tests, docs, risks)
* Add labels: `type:feature`, `area:prism`, etc. 🏷️

Now automation wakes up ⚙️.

### 5.4 PR → Automation ⚙️🚦

GitHub Actions run:

* 🧪 Tests
* 🧹 Linting
* 🧱 Build
* 🛡️ Security / policy checks

Results show as:

* ✅ pass
* ❌ fail

🤖 **TestAgent** can:

* Read logs 📜
* Summarize the failure 🧠
* Suggest fixes 💡

No merge happens until checks are green (or explicitly overridden in emergencies).

### 5.5 Review → Merge 👀✅

* 🧍 Maintainers + reviewers read code, tests, docs
* 🤖 specialized agents (ComplianceAgent, etc.) add comments
* For sensitive changes 🛡️:
  * Human approval is mandatory

When everyone is satisfied:

* PR gets approved ✅
* PR is merged 🔀→🌿
* Branch can be deleted 🗑️

### 5.6 Merge → Deploy → Learn 🚀📊🧠

After merge:

* Deploy workflows may run automatically ⚙️
* Artifacts go to staging or production 🚀
* MetricsAgent logs:
  * What version
  * When
  * From which PR/commit

If issues show up in production:

* Create new Issue(s) 📮
* Link back to the PR to close the loop ♻️

This is our **continuous improvement loop** inspired by Lean Startup and modern automation practice.

## 6. Standard GitHub Actions Workflows ⚙️

### 6.1 `ci.yml` – Continuous Integration 🧪

* Triggers:
  * Push to `main` 🌿
  * PRs 🔀
* Steps (typical):
  * Set up runtime (Python, Node, etc.)
  * Install dependencies
  * Run linters
  * Run tests

### 6.2 `docs.yml` – Documentation 📚

* Trigger: push to `main`
* Steps:
  * Build docs (Sphinx, MkDocs, etc.)
  * Publish to GitHub Pages or artifacts

### 6.3 `release.yml` – Releases 🏁

* Trigger: creating a tag (e.g., `v0.3.0`)
* Steps:
  * Build artifacts
  * Publish to registry
  * Create GitHub Release with notes

### 6.4 `nightly.yml` – Nightly Tasks 🌙

* Trigger: schedule (cron)
* Steps:
  * Run extended tests / simulations
  * Collect metrics 📊
  * Push metrics JSON to central repo or folder

These patterns are inspired by CI/CD best practices from GitHub documentation and automation literature.

---

## 7. Safety, Governance, and Sensitive Areas 🛡️

### 7.1 Branch Protection 🌿🛡️

For `main` (and other critical branches):

* Require PRs 🔀
* Require ✅ status checks
* Require at least one human review 🧍
* Limit who can merge 🔐

### 7.2 Sensitive Paths 🔒

Some folders need extra care:

* `/ledger/`
* `/security/`
* `/compliance/`
* `/identity/`

Rules:

* Small, well-documented changes only
* ComplianceAgent 🛡️ must comment or approve
* Human Owner/Maintainer must sign off 🧍✅

This matches the idea from automation & safety literature: **high-risk operations require stronger controls and human oversight.**

---

## 8. Metrics & KPIs 📊

We track metrics so we don’t fly blind.

Examples:

* 📮 Issues
  * Open vs closed
  * Time to first response
  * Time to close
* 🔀 PRs
  * Time from open → merge
  * Number of review cycles
* ⚙️ CI
  * Pass/fail rate
  * Average build time
* 🚀 Releases
  * Deployment frequency
  * Change failure rate

MetricsAgent 📊 can:

* Call GitHub APIs
* Write `metrics/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
* Generate basic charts or reports

This aligns with KPI and project-metrics literature: **measure flow, quality, and outcomes**, not just activity.

---

## 9. Onboarding Humans 🧍

1. Create a GitHub account 🧾
2. Join the BlackRoad org
3. Read:
   * `README.md` 📄
   * `CONTRIBUTING.md` 🤝
   * `AGENTS.md` 🤖
4. Clone a repo 📦
5. Create a small branch 🌿
6. Make a tiny change (docs, comment, typo fix)
7. Open a PR 🔀 and go through:
   * CI checks ⚙️🚦
   * Review 👀
   * Merge ✅

You learn by doing **one safe loop** end-to-end.

---

## 10. Onboarding Agents 🤖

1. Get a GitHub token 🔐 with minimal needed scopes
2. Read `AGENTS.md` in target repo
3. Start in **read-only** mode:
   * Summarize files
   * Suggest improvements as comments or issues
4. Then move to **read-write** via PRs:
   * Follow branch naming rules
   * Use PR templates
   * Explain reasoning 🧠💬
5. Respect safety rules:
   * No direct pushes to `main`
   * No touching sensitive paths without approval

All agent actions must be:

* Transparent 🧾
* Traceable 🕰️
* Reversible 🔄

---

## 11. This Manual as a Living System ♻️

This manual itself lives in GitHub 📦 and follows the same rules:

* Changes happen via Issues 📮 and PRs 🔀
* CI can:
  * Check links
  * Enforce formatting
  * Generate PDFs or HTML

Whenever something is unclear:

* Open an Issue describing the confusion 💡
* Or open a PR improving the text ✍️

Over time, humans 🧍 and agents 🤖 will evolve this manual into a rich, precise playbook.
