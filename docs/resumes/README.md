# Executive Resume Arsenal

This directory contains five tailored executive resumes exported as PDFs for distinct FinTech, RegTech, and AI leadership tracks. Each variant shares a consistent design language (dark-mode, ATS-safe typography) and includes activation placeholders for patent filings, funding confirmations, CFP timing, and proof microsite links.

## Activation Checklist

Every PDF includes an activation sidebar so the resume can be finalized in minutes:

1. **Patent Reference** — Replace `[INSERT USPTO PROVISIONAL APPLICATION NUMBER]` with the actual filing number to surface the IP moat.
2. **Funding Exact** — Swap `[ESTIMATE $200K - $400K]` with the confirmed raise (e.g., `$275K from ex-Ripple CTO`) for instant investor credibility.
3. **CFP Date** — Update `[PLANNING Q4 2025]` to `December 2025` (or the precise timeline) to signal execution readiness.
4. **/proofs Microsite** — Upload redacted audit decks and demos to the shared Notion workspace, then link directly from outreach emails.
5. **GitHub Boost** — Add the live stars badge to the Prism Console repository README to broadcast community traction.

Use each PDF individually when applying to targeted roles, or send the entire set with filenames prefixed by “Tailored for [Role]” when engaging executive recruiters.
