# Prism Console 90-Day Focus Map

## Purpose
The Prism Console program enters its first 90-day execution window with a mandate to translate the 20-phase roadmap into tangible business traction. This focus map articulates three leverage areas that deliver compound impact when advanced in parallel, and defines the rituals, metrics, and accountability loops that keep execution grounded in customer value and operational excellence.

## Leverage Areas & Objectives

### 1. Customer Activation & Insight Loop
- **Objective**: Convert roadmap capabilities into activated usage across priority customer segments while deepening understanding of workflow gaps and desired outcomes.
- **Key Initiatives**:
  - Ship guided onboarding journeys and in-product messaging for the top three Prism Console personas.
  - Launch a rolling customer council (design partners + lighthouse accounts) to test roadmap increments bi-weekly.
  - Instrument funnel analytics and qualitative feedback capture across onboarding, key workflows, and retention signals.
- **Owner(s)**: Product Management (Console), Design Research, Customer Success Leads.

### 2. Operational Reliability & Observability
- **Objective**: Increase console resilience, reduce incident risk, and provide actionable telemetry for proactive remediation.
- **Key Initiatives**:
  - Harden core services with SLO-backed error budgets, automated runbooks, and on-call coverage.
  - Expand observability stack (metrics, logs, traces) with golden signals and alerting for the top five user journeys.
  - Integrate security posture checks into deployment pipeline and quarterly tabletop exercises.
- **Owner(s)**: Platform Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering, Security Operations.

### 3. Growth Experimentation & Enablement
- **Objective**: Build a repeatable pipeline for growth hypotheses, experiment velocity, and revenue enablement alignment.
- **Key Initiatives**:
  - Stand up an experimentation backlog with clear hypothesis templates, guardrails, and instrumentation plans.
  - Partner with Revenue Enablement to produce console value narratives, playbooks, and competitive positioning updates.
  - Establish data integrations that surface usage signals into GTM systems for timely customer outreach.
- **Owner(s)**: Growth Product, Revenue Enablement, Data Strategy.

## Metrics & Leading Indicators

| Growth Experimentation & Enablement | Qualified expansion opportunities sourced | ≥ 6 | Lagging |

## Cadence & Rituals
- **Weekly Leadership Sync (45 min)**: Review metric deltas, unblock cross-functional dependencies, and surface new risks. Owners provide red/yellow/green status by lever.
- **Bi-Weekly Customer Council**: Demo increments, capture structured insights, and decide pivot/persevere on roadmap items informed by customer pull.
- **Monthly Reliability Review**: Inspect SLO adherence, incident postmortems, and automation backlog prioritization.
- **Monthly Growth Experiment Demo Day**: Share outcomes, decide on scale/iterate/retire actions, and publish learnings to GTM teams.

## Feedback & Governance Loops
- **Metrics Dashboards**: Centralized in Prism Analytics with automated distribution to stakeholders each Monday.
- **Retrospectives**: End of every sprint, include representation from product, engineering, design, GTM, and support. Feed learnings into roadmap adjustments.
- **Risk Register**: Maintained within the program management workspace with ownership, mitigation plans, and review cadence.
- **Executive Checkpoint (Day 45 & Day 90)**: Present progress against leverage areas, metric trajectories, and investment asks; align on next-horizon priorities.

## Dependencies & Enablers
- Staffing finalized for critical roles: Growth PM, SRE rotation, Revenue Enablement partner.
- Tooling upgrades: Experimentation platform license, observability dashboards, customer feedback repository.
- Data governance alignment for sharing usage insights with GTM tooling compliant with privacy and security requirements.

## Exit Criteria
- Documented customer journeys demonstrating measurable value realization in target segments.
- Reliability posture maintains SLO compliance with clear escalation and remediation loops.
- Growth experimentation pipeline consistently producing insights that translate into revenue enablement actions and expansion opportunities.

## Next Steps Post-Day 90
- Re-baseline roadmap based on customer council inputs and performance trends.
- Evaluate automation opportunities identified during reliability and growth cadences.
- Prepare next 90-day focus map emphasizing scale initiatives informed by outcomes from this cycle.
