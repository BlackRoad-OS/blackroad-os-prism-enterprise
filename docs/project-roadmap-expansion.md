# [06D4ZW0WPV5ABKS9K59PR8WTJM] Comprehensive Project Roadmap Expansion
UID: 06D4ZW0WPV5ABKS9K59PR8WTJM

This document captures the current end-to-end roadmap spanning environment readiness, hardware deployment, remote access, professional enablement, corporate formation, financial licensing, and long-range planning. It translates the latest planning notes into an actionable reference for cross-functional teams.

## Phase 1: Development Environment & Version Control

### Code Repository Management (Priority: High | Timeline: Week 1)
- Review all open merge requests in working branches and validate each against the latest `main` commit.
- Run the full automated test suite for every branch prior to merge approval.
- Merge ready changes into `main`, tag the release, update `CHANGELOG.md`, and prune obsolete branches.

### Documentation Updates (Priority: High | Timeline: Week 1)
- Refresh `README.md` with the current system architecture narrative.
- Document hardware configurations and publish setup guides for each device class.
- Add remote access procedures to the documentation set.

## Phase 2: Hardware Infrastructure Setup

### Device Inventory & Specifications
- Raspberry Pi 5 (2 units) — “Lucidia” 11.1" display and “Lucidia” (secondary) 4x4" display.
- Raspberry Pi 400 “Alice” with 10.1" display (integrated keyboard form factor).
- Raspberry Pi Zero — assign hostname and operating role.
- Jetson Orin Nano IO Base — assign hostname and workload focus.
- Control devices: MacBook Pro (primary development) and iPhone (remote management).

### Raspberry Pi Restoration & Configuration (Priority: High | Timeline: Weeks 1–2)
For each Pi:
1. Flash the latest compatible OS, configure hostnames, static IPs, SSH, and firewall rules.
2. Apply full system updates, install core tooling, enable unattended upgrades, and schedule backups.
3. Configure displays, power management, and (if applicable) touchscreen calibration.
4. Set up network connectivity (Wi-Fi + Ethernet), SSH keys, VNC/RDP, and validate throughput.
5. Standardize software versions, synchronize configuration files, deploy codebases, centralize logging, and confirm NTP syncing.

### Jetson Orin Nano Setup
- Install JetPack SDK with CUDA and TensorRT support.
- Configure GPIO/peripheral access and provision required AI/ML frameworks.

## Phase 3: Remote Access Infrastructure (Priority: Medium | Timeline: Week 2)
1. Configure iPhone SSH tooling (Termius/Blink Shell), profiles, keys, and saved sessions.
2. Stand up VNC/remote desktop (RealVNC/Jump Desktop) across devices, including relay options for off-network access.
3. Enable SFTP and Samba for file transfers; validate upload/download workflows.
4. Establish monitoring (dashboards, uptime alerts, push notifications) and quick-action shortcuts.
5. Configure VPN, router port forwarding (if necessary), document IP/port matrices, and test cellular remote access.

## Phase 4: Professional Development — Resume Completion (Priority: High | Timeline: Week 2)
1. Update work history, skills, certifications, and education with embedded systems emphasis.
2. Highlight Raspberry Pi/Jetson, Python/C++, Git, hardware/software integration, and AI/ML experience.
3. Produce ATS-friendly PDF/Word templates, proofread, gather peer feedback, and create role-tailored variants.

## Phase 5: Academic & Research Publications — White Paper Publishing (Priority: Medium-High | Timeline: Weeks 3–4)
1. Finalize technical narratives, diagrams, abstracts, executive summaries, and reference sections; secure peer review.
2. Publish via owned channels (site/blog) and external platforms (arXiv, Medium/Substack, LinkedIn, Academia/ResearchGate, relevant journals).
3. Define topics (e.g., Pi clusters, edge/embedded AI, IoT security) and confirm scope alignment.
4. Promote post-publication through social networks, community forums, mailing lists, and engagement tracking.

## Phase 6: Business Entity Formation — C Corporation Registration (Priority: High | Timeline: Weeks 3–5)
1. Pre-registration: select and reserve company name, choose incorporation state, draft stock structure, identify directors, and articulate mission/vision statements.
2. Legal documentation: file Articles of Incorporation, draft bylaws and shareholder agreements, issue stock certificates, and record organizational minutes.
3. Regulatory compliance: obtain EIN, register for state taxes, appoint registered agent, file FinCEN BOI report, and research licenses.
4. Banking & finance: open corporate bank accounts, implement accounting software, establish corporate credit, and choose accounting method.
5. Ongoing compliance: schedule board/annual meetings, maintain compliance calendar, and designate corporate secretary.

## Phase 7: Financial Services Licensing

### Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) Registration (Priority: High | Timeline: Months 2–4)
1. Validate SEC/state thresholds, projected AUM, and licensing requirements (Series 65 or Series 7 + 66).
2. Prepare Form ADV Parts 1, 2A, and 2B with supporting documentation.
3. Build compliance infrastructure: policies/procedures, Code of Ethics, Reg S-P privacy policy, ADV delivery, and records management.
4. Engage securities counsel/compliance consultants, secure E&O and cybersecurity insurance, and draft client agreements.
5. Complete IARD registration, submit Form ADV, respond to deficiency letters, and track review windows (45–90 days typical).

### Broker-Dealer (BD) Registration (Priority: High | Timeline: Months 3–6)
- Assess capital requirements ($100K–$500K+), FINRA membership obligations, licensing (Series 24, Series 7/63/66), and compliance overhead.
- Evaluate alternatives (partner BD, RIA-only, hybrid models) before committing.
- If proceeding: retain securities attorney, file Form BD, join FINRA, register principals/representatives, meet net capital rules, and draft supervisory procedures/AML programs.
- Implement trade surveillance, AML, CIP, complaint handling, FINRA reporting, and technology stack for compliance.
- Budget for ongoing costs: fees, compliance tooling, consulting, insurance, and audits.

## Phase 8: Strategic Planning & Documentation (Priority: Medium | Timeline: Week 4)
1. Build project timeline with dependencies, milestones, buffers, and visual Gantt artifacts.
2. Define business milestones (Month 1 infra, Month 2 incorporation, Month 3–4 RIA submission, Month 6 revenue, Year 1 scaling) and resource plans.
3. Document business model: revenue streams, customer personas, value proposition, pricing, and go-to-market.
4. Capture technical architecture diagrams, data flows, security posture, disaster recovery, and scalability roadmap.
5. Draft SOPs, onboarding workflows, QA processes, support procedures, and risk management matrices with mitigation/contingency plans and insurance reviews.

## Resource Requirements Snapshot
- **Budget:** C Corp $500–$2,000; RIA $5,000–$25,000; BD $100,000–$500,000+; Hardware/software $2,000–$5,000; Insurance $5,000–$20,000 annually; Professional services $10,000–$50,000 in year one.
- **Time:** Technical setup 40–80 hours; resume/publications 20–40 hours; business formation 40–60 hours; RIA registration 100–200 hours; BD registration 300–500+ hours.
- **Professional support:** securities attorney, compliance consultant, accountant/CPA, insurance broker, optional business consultant/mentor.

## Success Metrics & KPIs
- **Technical:** 100% device readiness and remote access; >99% uptime; merged code deployed successfully.
- **Professional:** Track weekly resume submissions, monthly white paper engagement, quarterly network expansion.
- **Business:** C Corp formation status, RIA submission/approval timeline, first client acquisition date, monthly revenue milestones.
