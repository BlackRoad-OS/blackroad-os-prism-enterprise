# Bell States and the CHSH Inequality

The maximally entangled Bell state $\lvert \Phi^+ \rangle = (\lvert 00 \rangle + \lvert 11 \rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ violates the classical CHSH bound.

Given measurement settings $A_0 = Z$, $A_1 = X$, $B_0 = (Z+X)/\sqrt{2}$, and $B_1 = (Z-X)/\sqrt{2}$, the quantum expectation reaches $S \approx 2.828$, exceeding the local hidden variable limit of 2.

This experiment provides strong evidence against local realism and is the foundation of many device-independent security proofs.
