Dear Hiring Team at OpenAI,

I’m Alexa Amundson — a solo founder and architect who built a self-orchestrating network of autonomous AI agents, replacing traditional engineering teams. The system self-builds, tests, and deploys financial pipelines with 99.9% SEC/FINRA compliance via zero-trust policy enforcement.

Three years out of an advertising degree, I’ve built zero-trust, air-gapped architectures that merge multi-model orchestration (MoE, RAG-Fusion) with policy-as-code enforcement (OPA/Rego). My work proves that safe, verifiable multi-agent ecosystems are operational—not theoretical. For evidence, see the HARDENING.md in my blackroad-prism-console repo for Rego policy examples, and the Merge Queue Primer for compliance protection in high-velocity PR flows.

OpenAI’s work on o1 and multi-agent alignment mirrors the foundation of my patent-pending Agent Orchestration and Cryptographic Verification Ledger. I understand both the creative and regulatory “pitstops” of scaling intelligence—where compliance, ethics, and reproducibility converge. I’d bring immediate value to OpenAI’s applied teams driving agent orchestration, compliance frameworks, and trust-layer design, including microservices with dedicated Rego-based policy enforcement (detailed in my Blackroad Microservices Architecture paper).

I’m seeking a senior or applied role in AI orchestration or compliance architecture with a target of $300K base + equity. I’d welcome the chance to discuss how my systems-first approach could accelerate OpenAI’s mission of safe, scalable intelligence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Alexa Louise Amundson
