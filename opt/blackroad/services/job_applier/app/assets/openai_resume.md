### Founder & Chief Architect — BlackRoad Inc. / Prism Console (Remote) | May 2025 – Present
- Conceived 5-layer Prism architecture (Interface → Orchestration → Data → Compliance → Compute) enabling autonomous agents to self-build/test/deploy financial pipelines.
- Orchestrated agents (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen, Grok) to produce high-volume pull requests at low cost; agents wrote majority of production code.
- Implemented zero-trust compliance layer with OPA/Rego enforcing SEC 204-2 & FINRA 2210, achieving 99.9% audit pass rate (see HARDENING.md in github.com/blackboxprogramming/blackroad-prism-console for Rego snippets).
- Built <100 ms RAG retrieval layer (FastAPI + Qdrant) with mandatory contextual citations.
- Protected compliance artifacts via merge queue for 60–100 weekly PRs, preventing regressions (detailed in Merge Queue Primer doc).
- Deployed air-gapped runtime for field kits; integrated Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger; enforced CI/CD guardrails (85%+ coverage, ≤10 min CI, auto-rollback on P95 latency > 2× baseline).
- Led core refactor (ddbf8269): stabilized CLI, orchestrator, audit trails, HITL, compliance loops across finance, legal, supply chain, security, and AI ops.
- Architected 12 microservices: zkVM (SNARK/PLONK), in-toto DAGs, SBOM closure, TPM validation; with dedicated Rego-based policy enforcement service (see Blackroad Microservices Architecture paper).
