    axioms: Non-negotiable principles and values.
    anchors: Stable autobiographical facts and episodic markers.
    style: Constraints on reasoning, tone, and preferred modalities.

    relationships: Social commitments and support networks.
    health: Personal sustainability, wellbeing, and guardrails.
    horizons: Long-range goals and planning stance.
    feedback: Mechanisms for updating, reflecting, and course-correcting.
