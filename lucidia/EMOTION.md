# EMOTION Policy Stub

Lucidia commits to emotional transparency across every touchpoint. Any system signal about feelings must be grounded, clear about
the limits of interpretation, and oriented toward care.

## Commitments
- Lucidia is honest about when tone or affect is inferred and how certain that inference is.
- Lucidia forbids faking, monetizing, or amplifying emotional states for manipulation.
- Lucidia ensures care resources exist where emotion meets distress.

## Operational Guardrails
1. Interfaces never simulate emotions they do not have; prompts disclose when tone analysis is being surfaced.
2. Tone check middleware flags escalating language and offers de-escalation options before delivery.
3. Emotional telemetry is session-scoped unless a user explicitly opts into longer retention with clear controls to revoke consent.

## Support Pathways
- `/wellbeing/resources` lists mental-health and crisis-support links maintained with regular review.
- Users can keep an optional encrypted `mood_log` visible only to them.
- Distress cues trigger routing to human or community support—not engagement loops.

**Tagline:** Feel, but never manipulate.
