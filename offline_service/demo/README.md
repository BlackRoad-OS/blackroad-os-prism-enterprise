# Offline Policy Demo

This directory collects example payloads and scripts that exercise the offline policy server.

* `good_evaluation.json` — a policy case with all rules passing.
* `fail_evaluation.json` — a policy case that triggers a failure.
* `remediation.json` — sample marketing copy that requires remediation.

Use `demo.sh` from the repository root to replay these scenarios against a running server.
