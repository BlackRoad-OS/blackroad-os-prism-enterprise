# Unity Exporter

Generates a ready-to-open Unity project template with a starter scene, movement script, and baseline project settings. The service packages everything into `downloads/unity-project.zip`.

## Automation hooks

- `python agents/unity_world_builder.py` wraps the exporter for the command bus.
- The CLI accepts flags for project metadata and emits either a human summary or JSON payload.
- Agent intent `build unity world` maps directly to this command for hands-free exports.

## API

- **Endpoint:** `POST /export`
- **Body (optional):**
  ```json
  {
    "projectName": "BlackRoad Sandbox",
    "sceneName": "PrototypeScene",
    "scriptName": "SandboxController",
    "description": "Exploration sandbox starting point",
    "author": "Sim Team",
    "projectVersion": "2022.3.29f1"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "ok": true,
    "path": "<absolute path to zip>",
    "projectFolder": "BlackRoadSandbox",
    "bytes": 32145,
    "files": ["README.md", "Assets/Scripts/SandboxController.cs", ...],

      "author": "Sim Team",
      "generatedAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
  ```

## Contents

The archive contains:

- `README.md` with onboarding instructions for collaborators.
- `Packages/manifest.json` preloaded with HDRP-friendly dependencies.
- `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` and `ProjectSettings.asset` placeholders.
- `Assets/Scenes/<SceneName>.unity` featuring a configured camera, directional light, and sample floor mesh.

## Local Development

```bash
cd workers/unity
npm install
npm start
```

With the server running you can trigger an export:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/export \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectName":"BlackRoad Sandbox","sceneName":"PrototypeScene"}'
```

A lightweight scaffolding service that builds a Unity-compatible project template and delivers it as a ZIP archive. Use it to bootstrap prototypes while the full build pipeline is under construction.

## Features

- Generates a structured Unity project with Assets, Packages, and ProjectSettings folders.
- Accepts metadata such as project name, scene names, notes, and package overrides.
- Emits a `BlackRoad/export.json` manifest summarizing the export payload.
- Available as both an HTTP endpoint and a local CLI helper (`npm run export:sample`).

## Quick Start

```bash
cd workers/unity
npm install
npm run export:sample
```

The sample script writes a fresh archive to `downloads/unity/` and prints the metadata payload. Feel free to edit `scripts/export-sample.mjs` to match your prototype requirements.

To run the HTTP service instead:

```bash
npm start
```

This launches the Express server on `http://localhost:3000`. Use the `/export` route described below.

## HTTP API

`POST /export`

**Request body**

```json
{
  "projectName": "BlackRoad Sandbox",
  "description": "Playable block world prototype",
  "author": "PrototypeAgent",
  "scenes": ["Landing", "Gameplay", "Credits"],
  "notes": "Focus on controller feel + chunk streaming",
  "packages": [
    "com.unity.cinemachine@2.9.7",
    { "name": "com.unity.postprocessing", "version": "3.4.1" }
  ]
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "path": "/workspace/blackroad-prism-console/downloads/unity/blackroad-sandbox-2025-10-05T00-00-00-000Z.zip",
  "fileName": "blackroad-sandbox-2025-10-05T00-00-00-000Z.zip",
  "bytesWritten": 14823,
  "project": {
    "projectName": "BlackRoad Sandbox",
    "slug": "blackroad-sandbox",
    "description": "Playable block world prototype",
    "author": "PrototypeAgent",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-05T00:00:00.000Z",
    "scenes": [
      { "name": "Landing", "file": "Assets/Scenes/Landing.unity" },
      { "name": "Gameplay", "file": "Assets/Scenes/Gameplay.unity" },
      { "name": "Credits", "file": "Assets/Scenes/Credits.unity" }
    ],
    "packages": {
      "com.unity.collab-proxy": "2.0.6",
      "com.unity.inputsystem": "1.7.0",
      "com.unity.textmeshpro": "3.0.6",
      "com.unity.cinemachine": "2.9.7",
      "com.unity.postprocessing": "3.4.1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation rules

- `projectName` must be a non-empty string.
- `scenes` can be a string or array; invalid entries are replaced with numbered placeholders.
- `packages` accepts arrays of strings (`"name@version"`), arrays of `{ name, version }` objects, or a dictionary of package names to versions.

### Output Layout

The exported archive contains:

```
<ProjectSlug>/
  README.md
  BlackRoad/export.json
  Documentation/notes.md
  Assets/
    Scenes/<Scene>.unity
    Scripts/README.md
  Packages/manifest.json
  ProjectSettings/
    ProjectSettings.asset
    ProjectVersion.txt
    EditorBuildSettings.asset
```

Use the placeholders as a starting point and replace them with production-ready content inside the Unity editor.
Generates a ready-to-open Unity project template that boots with a welcome scene, camera, light, and a simple `MonoBehaviour` script. The exporter hydrates placeholders in the template so each archive reflects the requested project and scene names.

## API

### `GET /health`
Returns `{ ok: true }` for liveness probes.

### `POST /export`
Creates a zipped Unity project under `downloads/`.

**Request body**
```json
{
  "projectName": "BlackRoadExplorer",
  "sceneName": "LandingScene"
}
```
Both fields are optional; they default to `BlackRoadUnityProject` and `MainScene` when omitted.

**Response**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "path": "downloads/blackroadexplorer.zip",
  "projectName": "BlackRoadExplorer",
  "sceneName": "LandingScene",
  "archiveName": "blackroadexplorer.zip"
}
```

The archive contains:
- `Assets/Scenes/<Scene>.unity` — starter scene with camera, light, and welcome rig.
- `Assets/Scripts/WelcomeController.cs` — rotates the rig and logs the welcome message.
- `Packages/manifest.json` — standard desktop dependencies.
- `ProjectSettings/` — version/build settings so Unity opens the project without prompts.
- `README.md` — instructions embedded in the template.

The exporter requires the `zip` CLI (available in the runtime containers used by this repo).

## Generated layout

The exporter synthesises a Unity-friendly skeleton:

```
<project>
├── Assets/
│   └── Scenes/
│       └── <SceneName>.unity
├── Packages/
│   └── manifest.json
├── ProjectSettings/
│   ├── EditorBuildSettings.asset
│   ├── ProjectSettings.asset
│   └── ProjectVersion.txt
└── README.md
```

Scene files use a lightweight YAML stub with a root `GameObject` so Unity can import them immediately.

## Development

```bash
cd workers/unity
npm install
node server.js
```

Send a request with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/export \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"projectName":"Test","scenes":["Main"]}'
```

Run the automated test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

The service requires the `zip` CLI (present in the base container and Dockerfile).

The generated scene can be opened directly in Unity. Customize the request body to stamp a project/scene name and share the resulting archive with other agents.
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "projectName": "OptionalName",
    "description": "Optional summary that lands in README.md"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "ok": true,
    "projectName": "OptionalName",
    "zipName": "OptionalName-1700000000000.zip",
    "zipPath": "<repo>/downloads/OptionalName-1700000000000.zip",
    "filesGenerated": 6
  }
  ```

## Output
The archive includes:
- `README.md` primed with the supplied description.
- `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` targeting Unity `2022.3.16f1`.
- A minimal `EditorBuildSettings.asset` referencing the prototype scene.
- `Packages/manifest.json` with baseline dependencies used across our tooling.
- `Assets/Scenes/Prototype.unity` containing a bootstrapped scene root.
- `Assets/Scripts/Bootstrap.cs` to verify scripting setup.

## Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- The `zip` CLI (`apt install zip` on Debian/Ubuntu) used to package the scaffold.

## Local Development
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (only Express at the moment).
2. Start the worker: `node server.js` (or `npm start` if you add a script).
3. Trigger an export:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/export \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{"projectName": "BlackRoadPrototype", "description": "Shared sandbox for gameplay experiments."}'
   ```
4. Retrieve the zip from the `downloads/` directory.

## Next Steps
See [`TASKS.md`](./TASKS.md) for coordination notes and upcoming improvements.
HTTP service that assembles a ready-to-open Unity project archive.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /export`
- **Output:** `downloads/<project-name>-<timestamp>.zip`

## Request Body

```json
{
  "projectName": "OrbitalGarden",
  "sceneName": "Greenhouse",
  "summary": "Prototype a systems-driven farming loop inside a biodome.",
  "features": [
    "Day/night cycle tied to plant growth",
    "Oxygen budget that shifts with player actions",
    "Narrative beats delivered via radio chatter"
  ]
}
```

All fields are optional. Sensible defaults are supplied when omitted.

## Archive Layout

The generated project contains a conventional Unity folder structure:

```
<ProjectName>/
  Assets/
    Scenes/
      <SceneName>.unity
      <SceneName>.unity.meta
    Scripts/
      <SceneName>Director.cs
      <SceneName>Director.cs.meta
  Packages/
    manifest.json
  ProjectSettings/
    EditorBuildSettings.asset
    ProjectSettings.asset
    ProjectVersion.txt
  README.md
```

`manifest.json` references common packages (Cinemachine, Input System, Timeline, TextMeshPro, Test Framework) to accelerate prototyping.

## Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "path": "/workspace/blackroad-prism-console/workers/unity/downloads/OrbitalGarden-2025-10-05T14-33-21-123Z.zip",
  "fileName": "OrbitalGarden-2025-10-05T14-33-21-123Z.zip",
  "files": [

    "OrbitalGarden/Assets/Scripts/GreenhouseDirector.cs",
    "OrbitalGarden/Assets/Scripts/GreenhouseDirector.cs.meta",
    "OrbitalGarden/Packages/manifest.json",
    "OrbitalGarden/ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset",
    "OrbitalGarden/ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset",
    "OrbitalGarden/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt",
    "OrbitalGarden/README.md"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "projectName": "OrbitalGarden",
    "sceneName": "Greenhouse",
    "scriptClass": "GreenhouseDirector",
    "unityVersion": "2022.3.17f1",
    "generatedAt": "2025-10-05T14:33:21.123Z",
    "featureCount": 3
  }
}
```

## Notes

- Archives are written to `workers/unity/downloads/` by default. Clean the directory periodically if space becomes an issue.
- The generated scene includes a `MonoBehaviour` that echoes the requested summary and features at runtime.
- Replace the stub YAML/Text content with authoritative exports when the real build pipeline is available.
