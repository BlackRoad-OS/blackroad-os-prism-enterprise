# Product → Merchandising → Service Workflow

1. Align product roadmap updates with merchandising briefs and channel plans.
2. Run Merchandising-BOT to generate the updated assortment using the latest sales history fixtures.
3. Feed the assortment into S&OP-BOT to balance supply, inventory buffers, and logistics partners.
4. Share the consolidated plan with Store-Ops-BOT so field teams receive labor plans and launch checklists.
5. Route financing and hedging requirements through Treasury-BOT to confirm cash coverage for the launch.
6. Hand service readiness and closeout milestones to Close-BOT to track post-launch reconciliations and support playbooks.
