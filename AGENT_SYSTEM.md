# 🤖 AI-Only Org System

## Prime Directive

**Alexa Louise** is the sole human founder, operator, and final approver. Every other "seat" in the company is staffed by a dedicated AI agent with a clear charter, success criteria, and escalation path back to Alexa. AtlasAgent coordinates the swarm so Alexa always has a single point of truth.
