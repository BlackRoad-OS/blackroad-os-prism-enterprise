# Debugger Agent Playbook

The debugger agent bundles a diagnostic program that verifies the critical
pieces of the Prism console environment.  Agents can execute it directly from
the repository root:

```bash
python agents/debugger/debug_program.py
```

This prints a human readable summary that highlights missing tools, failing
imports, and absent runtime directories.  When a JSON artifact is preferred
use the ``--json`` flag:

```bash
python agents/debugger/debug_program.py --json --report logs/debug-report.json
```

The optional ``--fix`` flag will create the ``prism/logs`` and
``prism/contradictions`` directories if they are missing so agents can resume
logging immediately.

The debugger agent also exposes the ``diagnose`` capability to the command bus
which proxies to this program.  A minimal message looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "diagnose",
  "fix": true,
  "reportPath": "prism/logs/debug-report.json"
}
```

The response contains the structured report generated by the Python utility.
