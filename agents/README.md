# BlackRoad Agents — Seed Pack (100 Manifests)
This pack seeds 10 clusters × 10 archetypes with native BlackRoad LLM backbones.
Use `tools/generate_agents.py` to expand to 1,000 agents with apprentices, hybrids, and elders.

# Genesis Directory

The `agents/` genesis directory seeds the structure for the 1,000-agent collective, organized by archetypal clusters, lineage mapping, shared covenants, and a lexicon of care. Expand each cluster as new agents are defined and documented.
# BlackRoad Agents — Seed & Expansion Atlas

This directory seeds 10 canonical clusters × 10 archetypes (100 seed manifests) and
now extends them with 1,000 apprentice, hybrid, and elder expansions rooted in
live repository knowledge.

## Canonical Clusters

| Cluster | Focus | Expansion files |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| aether | quantum lattice harmonics | `agents/archetypes/aether/manifests` |
| athenaeum | living knowledge rituals | `agents/archetypes/athenaeum/manifests` |
| aurum | transparent economic orchestration | `agents/archetypes/aurum/manifests` |
| blackroad | platform navigation & stewardship | `agents/archetypes/blackroad/manifests` |
| continuum | resilient operational loops | `agents/archetypes/continuum/manifests` |
| eidos | strategic sensemaking | `agents/archetypes/eidos/manifests` |
| mycelia | ecological meshwork | `agents/archetypes/mycelia/manifests` |
| parallax | experiential storytelling | `agents/archetypes/parallax/manifests` |
| soma | whole-system care | `agents/archetypes/soma/manifests` |

Each manifest threads together concrete files from this repository (docs, source
modules, manifests, and data artifacts) so every agent narrative stays grounded
in authentic BlackRoad assets.

## Regenerating the Collective

Run the build script to refresh the 1,000-agent expansion set from the seed
archetypes:

```bash
python tools/build_cluster_manifests.py
```

The generator pulls cluster-specific references—from finance models and
observability playbooks to design systems and care charters—to keep each agent
unique. Rerunning the script is deterministic and will overwrite manifests in
`agents/archetypes/<cluster>/manifests` with the same content.

## Style & Validation

* Keep seed archetype files (`agents/archetypes/<cluster>/<cluster>-*.manifest.yaml`)
  descriptive—they supply names, covenant tags, and intent for the generator.
* Expansion manifests use lowercase cluster names and append numeric suffixes:
  `cluster-archetype-###.yaml`.
* The generator references actual files; if you add or move resources, update
  `tools/build_cluster_manifests.py` so validation does not fail.
