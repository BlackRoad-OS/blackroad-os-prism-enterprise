# Metaverse of Love and Light

## Our Vision

A peaceful, democratic metaverse built on love, consent, and community. A place where everyone has what they need, where voices matter equally, where families of all forms thrive, and where movement is free. No weapons. No violence. No kings, queens, or gods. Just us - supporting each other with words, care, and shared power from within.
