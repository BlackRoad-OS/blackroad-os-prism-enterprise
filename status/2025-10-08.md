# Daily Operations Brief — 2025-10-08

## Platform Health Overview
- **GitHub:** Core services are operational with no customer-impacting incidents reported overnight. September post-incident review flagged three Copilot-affecting events (rate limiter regression on Sept 15, outbound email delivery delays Sept 23–24, and intermittent API 404s on Sept 29) as migration-related risks to the Azure transition and associated feature freeze guidance.
- **Cloudflare:** Global dashboard shows full availability. The Sept 12 dashboard/API availability disruption was traced to Tenant Service API saturation caused by a configuration push; mitigations included rate limiting, horizontal scale-out, and hotfix rollback. Planned ICN (Seoul) maintenance remains scheduled for Oct 14, 2025 from 17:00–22:00 UTC with automatic traffic rerouting expected.
- **Google Cloud:** Service Health dashboard reports normal operations across monitored regions today. Recent localized advisories are limited to product-specific maintenance with no impact to current BlackRoad workloads.

## Strategic Actions
- Coordinate with GitHub partnership contacts on Azure migration timelines to ensure Copilot SLA commitments and integration rollouts remain within tolerance.
- Validate Cloudflare ICN maintenance playbooks, confirming reroute capacity modeling and communications artifacts are ready before the Oct 14 window.
- Continue monitoring Google Cloud advisories and confirm logging/alerting captures dependency services that underpin production workflows.

## Follow-Ups
- Determine whether to commission log-level incident tracking for GitHub and Cloudflare to feed reliability scorecards ahead of Q4 reporting.
- Prepare an executive briefing on GitHub's Azure migration dependency assumptions for the upcoming governance sync.
- Review Google Cloud service dependencies with platform owners to double-check redundancy and failover coverage.
