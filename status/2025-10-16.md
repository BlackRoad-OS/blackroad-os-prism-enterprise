# Daily Operations Brief — 2025-10-16

## Infrastructure Platforms
- **Google Cloud:** Dashboards and regional logs show no active incidents across core services (Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, BigQuery) as of Oct 16 15:00 UTC; continue spot-checking IAM and networking error rates.
- **Google Workspace:** Status dashboard shows all products operating normally (last update Oct 16, UTC); recent auth latency warnings cleared after 12 hours with no customer-impacting alerts.
- **Cloudflare Bangkok (BKK):** Scheduled maintenance window on Oct 16 from 19:00–23:00 UTC; prepare for regional rerouting or transient latency and confirm BKK traffic can drain to Singapore and Tokyo edges.
- **Fastly Salem (SXV):** New data center event on Oct 16 at 19:00 UTC; expect potential routing adjustments or cache warm-up delays while the new POP is added to load-balancing pools.

## Watch Points
- **Historical Google Outage:** Recall the global disruption earlier in 2025 that affected 50+ Google Cloud and Workspace services; maintain contingency validation even when dashboards are green and keep the post-incident runbook close at hand.
- **Cloudflare Maintenance Impact:** Monitor Bangkok traffic for performance degradation or packet loss during the maintenance window, especially latency-sensitive API traffic routed through that region.
- **Fastly Platform Shift:** Track edge routing and latency around the Salem deployment; confirm monitoring thresholds capture any anomalies, and watch cache-hit ratios while the POP warms.

## Next Steps
- Confirm that failover and alerting scenarios for Google Cloud services remain current given the prior outage.
- Stage mitigation plans for Cloudflare-regional traffic, including reroute testing for Bangkok-dependent workloads and validation of DNS failover policies.
- Validate Fastly observability dashboards for the new SXV data center, with emphasis on warm-up and cache-hit ratios post-cutover, and brief on-call staff if thresholds need temporary tuning.
- (Optional) Decide whether to enable extended monitoring for the next 24 hours if additional coverage is required.
