# Bitcoin Mining Market Brief — 7 Nov 2025

## Network & Difficulty
- **Network hash-rate:** 7-day SMA slipped ~1.2% week-over-week (≈1,134 EH/s → ≈1,120 EH/s).
- **Upcoming difficulty adjustment:** projected for ~12 Nov 2025 with an estimated −2.8% change.

## Revenue Pressure
- **Hash-price:** hovering near US$42–43 per PH/s per day amid light fee revenue and elevated difficulty.
- **Margin impact:** even with the anticipated difficulty dip, revenue-per-TH remains compressed; operators must keep focusing on cost discipline.

## Operational Implications
- **Efficiency focus:** prioritize rigs with top-tier J/TH and prune the tail of inefficient hardware.
- **Demand response edge:** in ERCOT and similar markets, miners that can rapidly curtail or shift load are earning higher premiums / avoided charges.
- **Protocol watch:** Stratum V2 + SRI stack remains in alpha/beta testing; no major fleet migrations announced in the last two weeks.

## Near-Term Actions to Consider
1. Model breakevens with a 2–3% lower difficulty but flat hash-price to confirm short-lived relief.
2. Rebalance deployment toward sites with flexible power contracts or active demand-response participation.
3. Track Stratum V2 readiness from pool vendors, but defer large migrations until stable releases land.
