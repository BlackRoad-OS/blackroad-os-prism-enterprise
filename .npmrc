; Default registry for local development. Override with NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY if needed.
; NOTE: Registry switched from internal (verdaccio.internal:4873) to public npm registry.
; This exposes the project to supply chain risks if private packages were previously hosted internally.
; Ensure all dependencies are available on the public registry.
; Recommended: Add a verification step in CI to check for missing/private packages.
