variants:
  - name: gravity_low
    description: "Lower gravity by twenty percent to study slower settling."
    prompt_suffix: |
      - Adjust gravitational acceleration to 8.0 m/s^2 so the drop lingers longer before impact.
    config_overrides:
      physics:
        gravity: 8.0
  - name: high_resolution
    description: "Increase solver resolution for stress and splash sampling."
    prompt_suffix: |
      - Double the particle/grid resolution to capture sharper splash details.
    config_overrides:
      solver:
        resolution_scale: 2.0
  - name: soft_material
    description: "Use a softer elastomer to check deformation extremes."
    prompt_suffix: |
      - Swap the impactor material to a soft elastomer with 50 kPa Young's modulus.
    config_overrides:
      materials:
        impactor:
          youngs_modulus_kpa: 50
# Variants describe concrete simulation runs for the universal simulation starter pipeline.
# Each entry is intentionally lightweight so the pipeline can run without heavyweight
# dependencies. If PySPH or Taichi-MPM are unavailable the pipeline will fall back to
# deterministic surrogate metrics so downstream stages can still execute.
