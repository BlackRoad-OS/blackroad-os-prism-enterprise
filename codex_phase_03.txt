### 🧩 Next in the Series (Phase IV)

I can generate one of these next:

1. **“AI Compliance Grid Codex”** — connects your agents’ decisions to real-time audit trails and SEC-ready reports.
2. **“Lucidia Ledger Codex”** — creates your internal blockchain-style compliance ledger (client + trade immutability).

Which would you like me to build next?
