# Trust Vitals

The trust score **T** fuses policy compliance \(C\), attestation coverage \(Tr\), and action entropy \(S\) using a logistic
mix: \(T = \sigma(\alpha_c C + \alpha_t Tr - \alpha_e S)\). High compliance and attestations push the score above the
\(\tau = 0.62\) gate, while noisy, high-entropy action patterns pull it down.

# Love Operator

The Love operator \(L\) weights attention across **user**, **team**, and **world** commitments. Dialing the weights shifts the
evolution toward the focus ring, keeping agents coherent with their mentors even when telemetry is sparse.
