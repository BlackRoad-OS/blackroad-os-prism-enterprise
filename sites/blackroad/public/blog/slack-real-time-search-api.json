By unveiling a real-time search (RTS) API and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, the company wants AI builders to treat Slack as a context engine that pipes live conversations, files, and channel metadata into their agents\u2014without the brittle exports and security gaps that have defined earlier integrations.</p>\n<h2>What shipped</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Real-time search API (RTS):</strong> An event-driven endpoint that lets approved agents request scoped slices of Slack data\u2014messages, files, reactions\u2014as conversations unfold. It respects channel-level permissions, so agents only see what the human who authorized them can access.</li><li><strong>Model Context Protocol server:</strong> Slack now hosts an MCP server that implements standardized tools and resources for agent frameworks. Instead of custom webhooks, builders can register an MCP tool, let Slack handle auth + scoping, and deliver responses back into the workspace.</li><li><strong>Updated platform guardrails:</strong> New API terms require explicit user consent, rate caps, and detailed logging. Slack also introduced policy templates for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 teams who need to evidence how agent requests are governed.</li></ul>\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n<p>Slack leadership is pitching conversational context as \u201cthe gold of the agentic era.\u201d Agents that operate inside a company\u2019s workflow need more than static knowledge bases\u2014they need to know who said what, in which channel, and with what attachments. By allowing fine-grained, live queries without copying data out of Slack, the platform is positioning itself as the secure substrate for workflow agents.</p>\n<p>For teams already living in Slack, this can remove an entire integration project. Instead of mirroring message archives into a separate datastore, agents can subscribe to RTS events, pull the snippets they need, and respond in-channel.</p>\n<h2>Early use cases to watch</h2>\n<ol><li><strong>Escalation copilots:</strong> Support or incident-response agents can watch high-severity channels and surface suggested runbook steps while linking to the exact conversation thread.</li><li><strong>Deal desks and RevOps:</strong> Revenue teams can pipe key deal discussions into CRMs or pricing agents that generate redlines, proposals, or approval checklists without copying sensitive attachments outside Slack.</li><li><strong>Security analyst sidekicks:</strong> SOC teams can let agents search containment channels, summarize timeline gaps, and verify that required approvals happened\u2014all inside the same workspace.</li><li><strong>Knowledge synthesis:</strong> Internal research agents can detect when questions repeat across channels and push curated answers or recommend experts to loop in.</li></ol>\n<h2>Risks and open questions</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Governance debt:</strong> Even with access controls, organizations need clear playbooks for when agents can retrieve DMs, private channels, or files that contain regulated data.</li><li><strong>Latency + cost:</strong> Real-time context is only useful if the agent platform can process RTS events fast enough. Teams will have to budget for continuous inference or caching strategies.</li><li><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong> Building automations around Slack\u2019s RTS feed could make migrations to other collaboration suites harder.</li><li><strong>Beta uncertainty:</strong> The RTS API and MCP server are in closed beta, with general availability pegged for early 2026. Expect API changes and limited support until then.</li></ul>\n<h2>Competitive landscape</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Microsoft Teams:</strong> Microsoft is leaning on Graph connectors and Copilot Studio, but still requires data duplication into Microsoft 365 tenants. Slack\u2019s pitch is less duplication, more real-time.</li><li><strong>Google Workspace:</strong> Duet AI integrations exist, yet Google lacks an equivalent event-driven context feed with MCP support. Builders must mix Apps Script and REST polling.</li><li><strong>Discord and open platforms:</strong> Discord\u2019s real-time gateway is powerful, but its permissions and enterprise compliance story lag Slack\u2019s new guardrails.</li><li><strong>Specialist agent hubs:</strong> Startups like Glean or Humane offer context platforms, yet none sit directly in daily chat workflows. Slack wants to collapse that distance.</li></ul>\n<h2>How to experiment today</h2>\n<ul><li>Join the closed beta waitlist and prepare a scoping matrix that maps which channels your agent actually needs.</li><li>Prototype with synthetic data: mock Slack events, run your agent against the MCP schema, and test your guardrails before production.</li><li>Plan for auditability: wire logs into your SIEM so every agent query has a human-readable trail.</li></ul>\n<p>Slack\u2019s move reframes chat history as operational context rather than archival baggage. If the beta lands well, expect AI teams to treat \u201cSlack context engineering\u201d as a new discipline alongside prompt design.</p>\n</body></html>\n"
