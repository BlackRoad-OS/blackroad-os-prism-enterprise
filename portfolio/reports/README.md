# Portfolio Reports

This directory collects paste-ready, presentation-friendly artifacts that support outbound applications and update packs.

## Job Packs

Each job pack bundles the following blocks so a hiring manager or recruiter can get a complete snapshot quickly:

- A 55-word ATS-safe summary of the candidate and value proposition.
- Six tailored bullets that map directly to core responsibilities.
- A short cover micro-note designed to fit application text boxes.
- An application Q&A JSON file for quick upload into job portals.

| Pack | Role | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #5 | Welocalize — Search Quality Rater (US) | [Markdown](./job-packs/pack-05-welocalize-search-quality-rater-us.md) · [JSON](./job-packs/pack-05-welocalize-search-quality-rater-us.json) |

Add future packs by dropping a Markdown narrative and companion JSON file in `portfolio/reports/job-packs/` and listing them in the table above.
